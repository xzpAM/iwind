# Iwind: Physics-Informed Wind Turbine Agent



**Iwind** is an autonomous intelligent agent framework designed for the structural analysis and disaster mitigation of offshore wind turbines. Unlike fragmented manual investigations, Iwind establishes a closed-loop engineering workflow that couples domain reasoning with the execution of high-fidelity simulations (such as **Zwind**, **OpenFAST**, and **OpenSees**) and multimodal field evidence interpretation.

By leveraging the **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)** framework, the agent autonomously plans multi-step tasks, invokes specialized calculation tools, and reflects on observations to provide traceable engineering judgments.



## 1. Core Architecture

- **ReAct Loop**: Implements a "Thought-Action-Observation" cycle to solve engineering problems through dialogue-driven tool invocation.
- **Encapsulated Tools**: Automatically manages dozens of internal tools for load calculation, stress analysis, and structural responses.
- **Multimodal Perception**: Uses a dedicated `Detector` module (YOLOv5 & Qwen3-VL) to extract structured attributes from post-disaster imagery.
- **Hybrid Intelligence**: Supports seamless switching between local **Ollama** deployments and online APIs (Deepseek/Qwen) for reasoning and planning.

## 2. Environment & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Ollama**: For hosting local fine-tuned models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B).
- **Databases**:
  - **MySQL**: For managing project data and agent memory.
  - **Neo4j**: For domain-specific Knowledge Graph (GraphRAG) reasoning.
  - **Redis**: For high-performance conversation caching and history.
- **GraphRAG**: Integrated Microsoft GraphRAG for complex global/local community-based queries.

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/xzpAM/iwind.git
cd Iwind
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd llm_backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Configuration

All system parameters are managed in `llm_backend/.env`. The agent uses these settings to determine which local or online service to call during its reasoning process.

## 4. Running the Agent

The Iwind system is fully encapsulated. Once the backend is launched, all simulations and calculations are performed automatically through agent dialogue.

### Start the System

```
cd llm_backend
python run.py
```

### Usage via Dialogue

The agent autonomously calls its internal simulation and calculation tools based on the conversation context.

**User Question**: "Simulate the foundation response of WT-7 under the 2011 East Japan Earthquake loads." 

**Agent Process**:

1. **Thought**: I need to retrieve seismic PGA data and WT-7's structural parameters from MySQL and Neo4j.
2. **Action**: Calls the internal `Zwind_Engine` tool via the automated interface.
3. **Observation**: Foundation cracks detected; tower remains stable (Strong Tower, Weak Foundation).
4. **Response**: Outputs a detailed report and recommends an **M-shaped** damping strategy.
